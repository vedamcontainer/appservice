Application clone from GITHUB and necessary packages installation in them 

Note: If the start_project.bat file was successfully executed with the config.ini input file at the beginning of the project, steps 1-6 are not required. 
This is because the batch file has already applied these changes based on the input provided in the config.ini file, located in the Company_1 
folder at the path C:\SAS Opera\start\Company_1.

1. Create two folders in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\application
	a AppService
	b WebClient
	Then, open the Command Prompt and navigate to the directory:  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\application to Clone the repositories:
	git clone https://github.com/Vedam123/TransactWiseFrontend WebClient
	git clone https://github.com/Vedam123/TrasactWiseBackend AppService
2. Set up the Python virtual environment in the AppService directory:
	Method 1 : Using Command Prompt
		>cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService
		>C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService -m venv erpenv
		> erpenv\Scripts\activate   --> Run activate file which will set the virtual enviornment like below for example
		(erpenv) C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService\erpenv\Scripts>
		then cd ../..
	Method 2 ; Using VS Code Terminal 
		In VS code terminal how to set the virtual environment
		PS C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService> cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService
		PS C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService> python -m venv erpenv
		PS C:\apps\tradetrack\AppService> .\erpenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
		(erpenv) PS C:\apps\tradetrack\AppService>
3. Install necessary packages in the AppService after setting up the virutal enviornment.
	Open the enviornment in VS code like 
		a. In Windows file explorer navigate to C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService>
		b. Open this in cmd in this folder and press code .  which opens the VS code
		c. Once after VS code is opened , Open the terminal in VS code and start the viritual environment
		d. check if the requirements.txt file exists in projects path (AppService )
		then start running the following 
			python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
			pip install flask
			pip install requests
			pip install numpy
			pip install -r requirements.txt
			pip freeze > requirements.txt
			python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
			flask run --port=8000
4. Change configuration file in the Python Flask code once the files are opened in AppService in VS code

	a. Open the file config.py under the folder AppService (:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService)
	b. Add the following DB_INSTANCES_BASE_PATH = "C:/SAS Opera/Companies"and save it 
5. Install necessary packages in WebClient as well
	check if package.json file exists in WebClient directory
	run the command from command prompt npm install react-scripts

6. Restart the entire application both front end and back end.
