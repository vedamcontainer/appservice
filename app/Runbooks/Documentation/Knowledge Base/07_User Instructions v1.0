Purchase Invoice (PO)
	This can be used to create invoice for Purchase Order
	This Invoice will be created automatically based on PO
	Some setups needs to be checked before creating the Invoice
	
	1. Ensure Default account headers are set in the Company
		Nav :  Modules > Common > View Companies
		Important also set the same default account headers at the department level as well modules > common > Department 
	2. Verify the Account types which are in default account headers matches to the CompanyConfig.js JSON for a company
		WebClient Application Level Navigation (Nav : modules > finance > config > CompanyConfig.js)  
			Improvement : In future a form will be created for this
	
	for example :
		A. The PO : 200638898 96euros in the Company 3001 with VAT 6% for the item MRF(ITEM1001)
		
		Account Type				Debit (EUR)	Credit (EUR)	Account Category
		Inventory/Purchases			90.57						Asset
		Input VAT					5.43						Asset
		Accounts Payable (Supplier 1)			48				Liability
		Trade Creditors (Supplier 2)			48				Liability
		Total						96			96
		
		If this is the way accounts should be posted for example , presuming 50% for two credit accounts 
		
		Create the following accounts in Module > Finance > Create Accounts
		
			Account					Account Type				Account Category		Default Account
			INVPUR-15012539574 		Inventory					Asset					Yes
			INVTAX-15012502362		Inventory Tax				Asset					Yes
			accp-15012535190		Accounts Payable			Liability				Yes
			ACPI-15012565830		Accounts Payable Internal	Liability				Yes
			
			Note : The Account Type must be unique while selecting default accounts as Yes
			that means you can create two accounts as defult accounts with the same Account type
			
			Account					Account Type				Account Category		Default Account
			INVPUR-15012539574 		Inventory					Asset					Yes
			INVBUY-15012539574 		Inventory					Asset					Yes
			
			There should not be two accounts with the same account type with default flag as Yes under the same currency.
			
		B. Now the account setups are done as above Now go to create default account header and add all the above 4 accounts there
			
			Accounts for DEFALT HEADER : PURDEF

			Invoice Number: PURDEF
			Currency:
			Account ID	Account Name	Account Number			Type						Balance
			8015	accp-15012535190	3001-40002-15012535190	Accounts Payable			0.00
			8020	ACPI-15012565830	3001-40002-15012565830	Accounts Payable Internal	0.00
			8010	INVPUR-15012539574	3001-40002-15012539574	Inventory					0.00
			8021	INVTAX-15012502362	3001-40002-15012502362	Inventory Tax				0.00
			
			While creating you would select the Company , so it is automatically add to the Company setups 
				Nav : Common > Companies > View Companies
				
		C. Now update the CompanyConfig.js file with the account types you setup like in the A, B steps above 
					
			AUTO_PURCHASE_INVOICE_CONFIG: {
				  invoice_status: "DRAFT",
				  po_new_status: "INVOICED",
				  po_order_status_filter: ["APPROVED", "Received"],
				  payment_terms: "NET 20",
				  account_types: {
					Credit: [
					  {
						account_type: "Accounts Payable",
						category: "Normal",
						distribution_percentage: 50,
					  },
					  {
						account_type: "Accounts Payable Internal",
						category: "Normal",
						distribution_percentage: 50,
					  },
					],
					Debit: [
					  {
						account_type: "Inventory",
						category: "Normal",
						distribution_percentage: 100,
					  },
					  {
						account_type: "Inventory Tax",
						category: "Tax",
						tax_type: "VAT",
						distribution_percentage: 50,
					  }
					],
				  }
				  
		D. Check in the PO configuration what are the statues of POs that can be Auto configured 
			Ensure the PO status can be auto invoiced in this setup : Nav : modules > purchase> config > config.js
			export const PO_ORDER_STATUS = [
				  { name: "Draft", short_name: "DRAFT", sequence: 10, toupdated: true },
				  { name: "Pending Approval", short_name: "PENDING", sequence: 20, toupdated: true },
				  { name: "Approved", short_name: "APPROVED", sequence: 30, toputaway: true, autoinvoice: true },
				  { name: "Sent to Vendor", short_name: "SENT", sequence: 40, toinspect: true },
				  { name: "Partial Receipt", short_name: "PARTIAL", sequence: 50, toputaway: true },
				  { name: "Received", short_name: "Received", sequence: 60, putaway: true, autoinvoice: true },
				  { name: "To Inspect", short_name: "TOINSPECT", sequence: 62, putaway: true },
				  { name: "Inspected", short_name: "INSPECTED", sequence: 65, putaway: true },
				  { name: "Invoiced", short_name: "INVOICED", sequence: 70, toputaway: true },
				  { name: "Payment Processing", short_name: "PAYMENT", sequence: 80, putaway: true },
				  { name: "Paid", short_name: "PAID", sequence: 90, putaway: true },
				  { name: "Closed", short_name: "CLOSED", sequence: 100 }
				];
		D. Now Run Auto create invoice process
			Nav : Modules > Finance > Purchase > Auto Create Invoice
				Enter the PO No : 200312641  ( the PO is in Received status )
				
			Now the PO invoice for the PO  is created successfully with the below distribution_percentage
			
			Invoice Number: 2002
			Invoice Amount: 96.00 EUR
			Line No		Is Tax Line		Account					Category		Type						Debit (€)	Credit (€)
			2001						3001-40002-15012535190	Liability		Accounts Payable			0.00		48.00
			2002						3001-40002-15012565830	Liability		Accounts Payable Internal	0.00		48.00
			2003		True			3001-40002-15012502362	Asset			Inventory Tax				5.76		0.00
			2004						3001-40002-15012539574	Asset			Inventory					90.24		0.00

			You can also check the PO 200638898 status is changed to INVOICED

Sales Invoice (SO)

	Create a Sales Order 200481203, Approve it 523.00  apply saltax 14% inclusive 
	
	The sales invoice distribution is expected to be done like below 
	
	Account								Debit (€)	Credit (€)
	Accounts Receivable (Customer 1)	366.10							70%
	Accounts Receivable (Customer 2)	156.90							30%
	Sales Revenue									458.77
	Sales Tax Payable								64.23

	Setups
	
	1. Ensure the following account types are present in the config.js (Nav : modules > finance > config > config.js
	
			Accounts Receivable		Asset					
			Accounts Receivable Internal  Asset
			Sales			Revenue
			Sales Tax		Liability
			
			Both the account receivables should be posted with 70%, 30% of sales invoice
	
	2. Create default Accounts using above account types		 
		
		Create the following accounts in  Nav : Module > Finance > Create Accounts
		
			Account					Account Type						Account Category		Default Account
			SALACCREC-16012568625	Accounts Receivable					Asset					Yes
			SALACCRECIN-16012530633	Accounts Receivable	Internal		Asset					Yes		
			SALREV-16012557354		Sales								Revenue					Yes
			SALTAX-16012554877		Sales Tax							Liability				Yes
			
			Note : The Account Type must be unique while selecting default accounts as Yes
			that means you can not create two accounts as defult accounts with the same Account type
			that is the reason there are two account types created Accounts Receivable, Accounts Receivable	Internal
			this limitation only for the default accounts creation because they will be linked with default account headers which inturn will be associated to Company
			
			Account					Account Type				Account Category		Default Account
			INVPUR-15012539574 		Inventory					Asset					Yes
			INVBUY-15012539574 		Inventory					Asset					Yes
			
			There should not be two accounts with the same account type with default flag as Yes under the same currency for example as above
			
	3. Add the above 4 Default accounts to the Default account header associated to the Department and Company
			Nav : modules > common > update company
			Nav : Modules > common > update department
	4. Now setup the CompanyConfigs.js as below   (Nav : WebClient > src > modules > finance > config > CompanyConfigs.js)

			AUTO_SALES_INVOICE_CONFIG: {
				  so_order_status_filter: ["PICKED", "PARTPICKED", "APPROVED"],
				  so_new_status: "INVOICED",
				  invoice_status: "DRAFT",
				  account_types: {
					Debit: [
					  {
						account_type: "Accounts Receivable",

						category: "Normal",
						distribution_percentage: 100,
					  },
					  {
						account_type: "Sales Tax",
						category: "Tax",
						tax_type: "saltax",							// It should be same tax type that is in the sales order , otherwise tax line will not be created
						distribution_percentage: 100,
					  }
					],
				  },
				},	
				
			
		5. Now run the Auto create Invoice proces entere the Approved SO 200481203
		
	Now sales invoice successfully created and now check the status of the sales order is changed to INVOICED
	
Inventory Operations (UOM Conversion)

		In the inventory ID : 1112 , I have an item ITEM1007 with 20 Each quantity , now I need to convert this to Dozzen
		
		First of all ensure Each is an UOM and Dozen is another UOM in UOM setups for Dozen the base unit must be Each 
		Nav : modules > common > View UOMs
		UOM ID	Abbreviation	UOM Name	Base Unit	Conversion Factor	Decimal Places	Notes
			1	Ea				Each		1			1						0				1 Each = 1 * Each
			2	Dz				Dozen		1			12						0				1 Dozen = 12 * Each
			3	CA				Carton		1			120						0				1 Carton = 120 * Each
			4	DP				HDozens		2			100						0				1 HDozens = 100 * Dozen
			
		1. Now convert the UOM of the inventory ID 1112 from Each to Dozzen
			Nav : modules > inventory > UOM conversion
		2. View the Inventory and observe how the item ITEM1007 how it is splitted

		Item ID	Item Code	Item Name	Quantity	UOM			Transaction Number	Transaction Type		Inventory ID	Bin Name			
		1000007	ITEM1007	SEATS		8			Each		1002				Receipts				1112			ROW11				
		1000007	ITEM1007	SEATS		1			Dozen		1002				Receipts				1114			ROW11	
			
Inventory Operations (Item Consolidation)

		This will consolidate items into one 1000001 for example 

			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		9	Each	1001	Receipts	1111	BIN3	RACK1					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		3	Each	1001	Receipts	1113	BIN3	RACK1	 ALREADY ALLOCATED 						
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		10	Each	31281	Receipts	1115	BIN2						
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		12	Each	22884	Receipts	1116		RACK4					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		18	Dozen	975		Receipts	1117				AISLE10			
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		14	Dozen	61458	Receipts	1118	BIN1			

		1. Consolidate the Item Inventory for the Item ITEM1001
			Nav : Modules > Inventory > Item Consolidation
					Transaction Type : Consolidation
					Source UOM : Each 
					Target UOM : Dozen
					Target aisle : RACK3
					
					10, 12, 9 should be consolidated to Target aisle of the item ITEM1001
					Success: Item Inventory Consolidation or UOM conversion transaction No is 8060190
		2. View Inventory 
					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	3	Each	1001	Receipts		1113	BIN3	RACK1				ALREADY ALLOCATED SO NOT CONSOLIDATED							
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	18	Dozen	975		Receipts		1117				AISLE10			
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	14	Dozen	61458	Receipts		1118	BIN1						
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	2	Dozen	8060190	Consolidation	1125		RACK3					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	7	Each	8060190	Consolidation	1126		RACK3

			Now you can observe the change there all the Each quantities and consolidated , however 7 quantity is left over can't be consolidated to Dozen
			
			Note : if the inventory is already allocated meaning if the status is Yes in the item_inventory table it will not be considered for consolidation because it is allocated for shipping
			
	
Inventory Operations (Item UOM Distribution)

		This process is opposite to consolidation above in which for example the Dozen quantties are splitted into Each and store in the inventory
		
		for example if we have situation for an inventory item like below 
		
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	3	Each	1001	Receipts		1113	BIN3	RACK1				ALREADY ALLOCATED 
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	18	Dozen	975		Receipts		1117				AISLE10			
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	14	Dozen	61458	Receipts		1118	BIN1						
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	2	Dozen	8060190	Consolidation	1125		RACK3					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF	7	Each	8060190	Consolidation	1126		RACK3
			
		1. Perform Inventory Distribution 
			Nav : Modules > Inventory > Item Consolidation 
				Type : Distribution
				Item : ITEM1001
				Source UOM : Dozen
				Target UOM : Each 
				Target Location : ZONE10
				
			Success: Item Inventory Distribution or UOM conversion transaction No is 4423279
		2. View the Inventory 
			Nav : Modules > Inventory > View Inventory 
			
		
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		3		Each	1001	Receipts	1113	BIN3	RACK1				ALREADY ALLOCATED SO NOT CONSOLIDATED			
			1000007	ITEM1007	SEATS	1		Dozen	1002	Receipts	1114			ROW11				
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		7		Each	8060190	Consolidation	1126		RACK3					
			1000001	ITEM1001	MRF		408		Each	4423279	Distribution	1127		ZON10LOC10	
			
			There are 18, 14, 2 Dozens , they are distributed as Each into ZONE location as 408
			
Inventory Operations ( Move Inventory)

		I can move the material from One Inventory storage to another storage location  
		You can only move the inventory ids where the status flag is not equal to Yes  ( if it is Yes it is already allocated for shipping)
		
		1. Move Inventory 
			Nav : Modules > Inventory > Move Inventory
				Item : ITEM1001
				Transaction Type : Receipts
				Inventory ID : 1111
				Inventory Quantity : 3
				Source Storage location : RACK1
				Move Quantity : 2
				Target Storage : RACK 10
				
				Success : Inventory moved successfully

			The Inventory is split from 3, and 2 quantity will be moved to RACK10 and 1 will remain in RACK1
		2. View Inventory 
			Nav : Modules > Inventory > View Inventory

Inventory Operations ( Create Storage locations)

		In order to receive or ship or store materials there needs storage 
		The following storage locations can be created 
		
		Nav : Modules > Inventory > Storage
		Create Warehouses
		Create Locations
		Create Zones
		Create Aisles
		Create Rows
		Create Racks
		Create Bins
		
		and You can View the Bins
