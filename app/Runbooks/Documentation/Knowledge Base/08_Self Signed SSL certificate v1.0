In order to launch the application with https we need domain and certificates, for testing purpose we can generate self signed certificates as below

OpenSSL does not provide official Windows installers. However, there are trusted third-party distributors who package OpenSSL for Windows

Open SSL Self Certifications: (WebClient)

1. Check if OpenSSL is already instlled in the windows 
	dir C:\ /s /b | findstr openssl.exe
2. Check if it is not installed then download it from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html for your windows 
3. Install it and locate its path directory and set path to it 
4. Then Go to Project directory WebClient and create a directory called certs
5. Come back to Project directory WebClient and run the command 
	openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certs/server.key -x509 -out certs/server.crt
	
	It will ask few questions to generte the key and certificate like below so fill them
	
		Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]: US
		State or Province Name (full name): New York
		Locality Name (e.g., city) [Default City]: New York
		Organization Name (e.g., company) [Default Company Ltd]: My Company
		Organizational Unit Name (e.g., section) []: IT
		Common Name (e.g., server FQDN or YOUR name) []: localhost
		Email Address []: admin@example.com
		
		You should now have two files in your certs directory:
			server.key: Your private key.
			server.crt: Your self-signed certificate.

6. 	Configure React App to Use HTTPS  .env file in the Project directory (WebClient)

		REACT_APP_WEB_CLIENT_PROTOCOL='https'
		REACT_APP_WEB_CLIENT_HOST=0.0.0.0
		REACT_APP_WEB_CLIENT_PORT='7104'

		PROTOCOL='https'
		HOST=0.0.0.0
		PORT='7104'

		SSL_CRT_FILE=./certs/server.crt
		SSL_KEY_FILE=./certs/server.key
	
7. Insall npm install cross-env --save-dev in the WebClient
8. Configure package.json file 
		"scripts": {
			"start": "cross-env HTTPS=true SSL_CRT_FILE=./certs/server.crt SSL_KEY_FILE=./certs/server.key react-scripts start"
		}
9. npm start


Open SSL Self Certifications: (AppServer)

1. Create a folder in AppServer (Project folder ) Folder name : certs
2. Copy the certificates created as part of WebClient and paste in this certs directory 
3. The config.py which is in the Project folder (AppServer) to be updated as below 
		APP_SERVER_HOST = "0.0.0.0"
		APP_SERVER_PORT = 8014
		APP_SERVER_PROTOCOL = "https"
4. Now change app.py file as below 
		import os 
		
		
		cert_path = os.path.join('certs', 'server.crt')  # Update to your actual certificate path
		key_path = os.path.join('certs', 'server.key')    # Update to your actual key path
		
		app.run(debug=True, host=APP_SERVER_HOST, port=APP_SERVER_PORT, ssl_context=(cert_path, key_path))
5. Also it is important to update .env file in WebClient (Front end project)

		REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVER_HOST='192.168.1.182'      --> This IP address you get from the server where it is running as ip4 address when you run ipconfig in command prompt
		REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVER_PORT='8014'
		REACT_APP_BACKEND_SERVER_PROTOCOL='https'


Note : Since you are launching the application with self signed certificate you may get security issues in browser ,
